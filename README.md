# dotfiles

Inspired from my the following dotfiles of [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and [holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) on GitHub.

However, I like to switch between bash and zsh. Therefore, wanted it to be tailored for my needs. 

**CURRENTLY USING ZSH.**
